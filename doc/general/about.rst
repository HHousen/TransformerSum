Overview
--------

``TransformerSum`` is a library that aims to make it easy to *train*, *evaluate*, and *use* machine learning **transformer models** that perform **automatic summarization**. It features tight integration with `huggingface/transformers <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`_ which enables the easy usage of a **wide variety of architectures** and **pre-trained models**. There is a heavy emphasis on code **readability** and **interpretability** so that both beginners and experts can build new components. Both the extractive and abstractive model classes are written using `pytorch_lightning <https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning>`_, which handles the PyTorch training loop logic, enabling **easy usage of advanced features** such as 16-bit precision, multi-GPU training, and `much more <https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/>`__. ``TransformerSum`` supports both the extractive and abstractive summarization of **long sequences** (4,096 to 16,384 tokens) using the `longformer <https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/longformer.html>`__ (extractive) and `LongformerEncoderDecoder <https://github.com/allenai/longformer/tree/encoderdecoder>`__ (abstractive), which is a combination of `BART <https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bart.html>`_ (`paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461>`__) and the longformer. ``TransformerSum`` also contains models that can run on resource-limited devices while still maintaining high levels of accuracy. Models are automatically evaluated with the **ROUGE metric** but human tests can be conducted by the user.

Check out the :ref:`installation instructions <installation_instructions>` and the :ref:`tutorial <getting_started_tutorial>` to get started training models and summarizing text.

Both extractive and abstractive processed datasets and trained models can be found in their respective sections. All models and datasets are available on the `TransformerSum Hugging Face Hub <https://huggingface.co/HHousen/TransformerSum>`_.

Features
--------

* For extractive summarization, compatible with every `huggingface/transformers <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`_ transformer encoder model.
* For abstractive summarization, compatible with every `huggingface/transformers <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`_ EncoderDecoder and Seq2Seq model.
* Currently, 10+ pre-trained extractive models available to summarize text trained on 3 datasets (CNN-DM, WikiHow, and ArXiv-PebMed).

* Contains pre-trained models that excel at summarization on resource-limited devices: On CNN-DM, ``mobilebert-uncased-ext-sum`` achieves about 97% of the performance of `BertSum <https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10318>`_ while containing 4.45 times fewer parameters. It achieves about 94% of the performance of `MatchSum (Zhong et al., 2020) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08795>`_, the current extractive state-of-the-art.
* Contains code to train models that excel at summarizing long sequences: The `longformer <https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/longformer.html>`__ (extractive) and `LongformerEncoderDecoder <https://github.com/allenai/longformer/tree/encoderdecoder>`__ (abstractive) can summarize sequences of lengths up to 4,096 tokens by default, but can be trained to summarize sequences of more than 16k tokens.

* Integration with `huggingface/nlp <https://github.com/huggingface/nlp>`_ means any summarization dataset in the ``nlp`` library can be used for both abstractive and extractive training.
* "Smart batching" (extractive) and trimming (abstractive) support to not perform unnecessary calculations (speeds up training).
* Use of ``pytorch_lightning`` for code readability.
* Extensive documentation.
* Three pooling modes (convert word vectors to sentence embeddings): mean or max of word embeddings in addition to the CLS token.

Significant People
------------------

The project was created by `Hayden Housen <https://haydenhousen.com/>`_ during his junior and senior years of high school as part of the Science Research program. It is actively maintained and updated by him and the community. You can contribute at `HHousen/TransformerSum <https://github.com/HHousen/TransformerSum>`_.

Extractive vs Abstractive Summarization
---------------------------------------

Models that perform **extractive summarization** essentially pick the best most representative sentences and copy them into a summary. Models that perform **abstractive summarization** generate new sentences that capture general ideas.

**Extractive summarization** is a **binary classification problem**. Either classify the sentence as "should be in he summary" or "should NOT be in the summary".

**Abstractive summarization** is a **sequence to sequence text generation problem**. This is significantly more difficult than extractive summarization since the machine has to synthesize the information it "reads" into a new form.

ROUGE Scores
------------

This project uses ROUGE to evaluate summarization quality. ROUGE, or Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, is a set of metrics used to evaluate automatic summarization systems. However, automatic metrics, such as ROUGE and METEOR, have serious limitations. They only assess content selection by calculating lexical overlap and do not account for other quality aspects, such as fluency, grammaticality, or coherence. More information about the limitations of ROUGE in `sebastianruder/NLP-progress <https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress/blob/master/english/summarization.md>`_.

This project integrates with `rouge-score <https://pypi.org/project/rouge-score/>`__ and `pyrouge <https://pypi.org/project/pyrouge/>`__ and either can be used when calculating ROUGE scores during the testing phase.

``rouge-score`` is the default option. It is a pure python implementation of ROUGE designed to replicate the results of the official ROUGE package. While this option is cleaner (no perl installation required, no temporary directories, faster processing) than using ``pyrouge``, this option should not be used for official results due to minor score differences with ``pyrouge``.

``pyrouge`` is a python interface to the official ROUGE 1.5.5 perl script. Using this option will produce official scores, but it requires a complicated setup. To install ROUGE 1.5.5 I followed `this StackOverflow answer <https://stackoverflow.com/a/28941840>`_ and ran the below `commands from Kavita Ganesan <https://kavita-ganesan.com/rouge-howto/>`_ (`Archive <https://web.archive.org/web/20200624011208/https://kavita-ganesan.com/rouge-howto/>`__) to fix the WordNet exceptions:

.. code-block::

    cd data/WordNet-2.0-Exceptions/
    ./buildExeptionDB.pl . exc WordNet-2.0.exc.db

    cd ../
    rm WordNet-2.0.exc.db
    ln -s WordNet-2.0-Exceptions/WordNet-2.0.exc.db WordNet-2.0.exc.db

.. note:: The official ROUGE website was http://www.berouge.com/Pages/default.aspx but has been offline for many years. The Internet Archive still has a copy `here <https://web.archive.org/web/20160402021817/http://www.berouge.com/Pages/default.aspx>`__. However, you can still download ROUGE 1.5.5 from `andersjo/pyrouge <https://github.com/andersjo/pyrouge/tree/master/tools/ROUGE-1.5.5>`_.

You can compute the ROUGE scores between a candidate text file and a ground-truth text file where each file contains one summary per line with the following command:

.. code-block::

    python -c "import helpers; helpers.test_rouge('tmp', 'save_gold.txt', 'save_pred.txt')"

Two flavors of ROUGE-L
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the ROUGE paper, two flavors of ROUGE-L are described:

    1. sentence-level: Compute longest common subsequence (LCS) between two pieces of text. Newlines are ignored. This is called rougeL in this package.
    2. summary-level: Newlines in the text are interpreted as sentence boundaries, and the LCS is computed between each pair of reference and candidate sentences, and something called union-LCS is computed. This is called ``rougeLsum`` in the `rouge-score <https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/rouge>`_ package.

Both ROUGE-L and ROUGE-L-SUM are calculated in this library.
