`TransformerSum` is a library that aims to make it easy to *train*, *evaluate*, and *use* machine learning **transformer models** that perform **automatic summarization**. It features tight integration with [huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) which enables the easy usage of a **wide variety of architectures** and **pre-trained models**. There is a heavy emphasis on code **readability** and **interpretability** so that both beginners and experts can build new components. Both the extractive and abstractive model classes are written using [pytorch_lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning), which handles the PyTorch training loop logic, enabling **easy usage of advanced features** such as 16-bit precision, multi-GPU training, and [much more](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/). `TransformerSum` supports both the extractive and abstractive summarization of **long sequences** (4,096 to 16,384 tokens) using the [longformer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/longformer.html) (extractive) and [LongformerEncoderDecoder](https://github.com/allenai/longformer/tree/encoderdecoder) (abstractive), which is a combination of [BART](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bart.html) ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461)) and the longformer. `TransformerSum` also contains models that can run on resource-limited devices while still maintaining high levels of accuracy. Models are automatically evaluated with the **ROUGE metric** but human tests can be conducted by the user.

**Check out [the documentation](https://transformersum.readthedocs.io/en/latest) for usage details.**

## Features

* For extractive summarization, compatible with every [huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) transformer encoder model.
* For abstractive summarization, compatible with every [huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) EncoderDecoder and Seq2Seq model.
* Currently, 10+ pre-trained extractive models available to summarize text trained on 3 datasets (CNN-DM, WikiHow, and ArXiv-PebMed).

* Contains pre-trained models that excel at summarization on resource-limited devices: On CNN-DM, ``mobilebert-uncased-ext-sum`` achieves about 97% of the performance of [BertSum](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10318) while containing 4.45 times fewer parameters. It achieves about 94% of the performance of [MatchSum (Zhong et al., 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08795), the current extractive state-of-the-art.
* Contains code to train models that excel at summarizing long sequences: The [longformer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/longformer.html) (extractive) and [LongformerEncoderDecoder](https://github.com/allenai/longformer/tree/encoderdecoder) (abstractive) can summarize sequences of lengths up to 4,096 tokens by default, but can be trained to summarize sequences of more than 16k tokens.

* Integration with [huggingface/nlp](https://github.com/huggingface/nlp) means any summarization dataset in the `nlp` library can be used for both abstractive and extractive training.
* "Smart batching" (extractive) and trimming (abstractive) support to not perform unnecessary calculations (speeds up training).
* Use of `pytorch_lightning` for code readability.
* Extensive documentation.
* Three pooling modes (convert word vectors to sentence embeddings): mean or max of word embeddings in addition to the CLS token.

## Pre-trained Models

All pre-trained models (including larger models and other architectures) are located in [the documentation](https://transformersum.readthedocs.io/en/latest). The below is a fraction of the available models.

## Install

Installation is made easy due to conda environments. Simply run this command from the root project directory: `conda env create --file environment.yml` and conda will create and environment called `transformersum` with all the required packages from [environment.yml](environment.yml). The spacy `en_core_web_sm` model is required for the [convert_to_extractive.py](convert_to_extractive.py) script to detect sentence boundaries.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/HHousen/transformersum.git`.
2. Change to project directory: `cd transformersum`.
3. Run installation command: `conda env create --file environment.yml`.
4. **(Optional)** If using the [convert_to_extractive.py](convert_to_extractive.py) script then download the `en_core_web_sm` spacy model: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`.
